bwall-s-smaller-projects
========================

Just a collection of my smaller projects, if anything takes off, I'll make a new repo for it

PHPShell: A research project I did to see how drastically the reverse engineering of a PHP backdoor could be.

MD5 Reverse: Some research I did with the MD5 algorithm when I was first getting into programming.  It partially reverses the MD5 algorithm based on the number of characters it is attempting for an input.

Factor: A project I did with making a big number class for finding large prime numbers.
